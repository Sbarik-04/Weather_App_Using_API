# Weather_App_Using_API
#Task:-Weather App
🔎 About the Project:
This Weather App was developed as part of Task-05 for my internship at Prodigy Infotech. The goal was to create a web application that interacts with a public weather API to display current weather information based on either user-inputted location 

The application allows users to:

Enter any city name to retrieve real-time weather data

View details like temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed

Understand how API calls, JSON parsing, and frontend rendering work together in a functional app

This project helped me enhance my practical knowledge of:

Working with REST APIs

JavaScript DOM manipulation

Handling async functions and API responses

Creating user-friendly, clean UI using HTML and CSS
